# Inferential-Statistics
In this project, I have used various statistical methods like T-test one sample, Probability, Conditional Probability, ANOVA (One way and Two way), t-test for two independent samples, Interaction plot, Tukey's HSD Test, Shapiro and Levene Test. 
Working on this project was an amazing experience for me as a beginner. 
Please don't hesitate to share any suggestions.
