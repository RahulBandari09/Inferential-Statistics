# Inferential-Statistics
In this project I have used various statistical methods like Ttest one sample, Probability, Conditional Probability, ANOVA (One way and Two way), ttest for two independent sample, Interaction plot, Shapiro and Levene Test. 
It was an amazing experience as a beginner to work on this project. 
Hope you share some meaningful insights or suggestions.
