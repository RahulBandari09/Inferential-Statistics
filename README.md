# Inferential-Statistics
In this project, I have used various statistical methods like T-test one sample, Probability, Conditional Probability, ANOVA (One way and Two way), t-test for two independent samples, Interaction plot, Tukey's HSD Test, Shapiro and Levene Test. 
It was an amazing experience as a beginner to work on this project. 
Please feel free to share some meaningful insights or suggestions.
